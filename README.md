The task of this assignment is to predict flight delay with statistical model.

1. You might need to take logarithm transform of the delay time to reduce its heavy tail.
2. Make appropriate transform to other variables if neccesary.
3. Using simple linear regression to predict flight delay as response. Use backward and forward selection to identify most relevant predictors.
4. Use regression tree or random forest to identify relevant predictors.
5. Compare the performance of your linear model and tree model on a test data or via cross-validation.
6. Create a binary response, which is 1 if delay is greater than one hour, and is 0 otherwise.
7. Fit a simple logistic regression to this binary response. Again, use forward or backward select to identify relevant predictors.
8. For all of the above model, intepret the selected variables. Is the result consistent with your exploratory analysis in HW1?
